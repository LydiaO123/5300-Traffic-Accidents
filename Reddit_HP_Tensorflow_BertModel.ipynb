I\\u2019m moving into the 3rd week of Celexa.  I really hope it settles down.  I\\u2019m going to take lisinopril in the morning instead of night.  I\\u2019ll check with the doctor if he thinks taking another dose at night would be good even though lisinopril is usually once a day dosing.  I know that takes a few weeks too but I can\\u2019t risk another mini stroke.  I\\u2019m hoping the day time dosing counteracts the BP spikes I\\u2019m having.\",\n          \"Apparently my response is too long because it won\\u2019t let me post it as one comment, so you\\u2019ll get 2 from me. Sorry. (This is 2 of 2) **Beverages**\\nBeing adequately hydrated can affect your BP. How much plain water should you drink each day? Drink as much as needed so that your urine is a light yellow color. (It is possible to drink too much water and when you do that you can lose too many vitamins, minerals, and nutrients.) Spreading it throughout the day gives your body a constant source and allows it to better process the water. You may begin to urinate more frequently when you first start drinking more water because when your body learns it will have a constant source of water, it isn\\u2019t afraid to let go of what it has stored.  Caffeine affects BP in some people but they haven\\u2019t figured out why. If you\\u2019re caffeine sensitive then you should probably eliminate it. You may have a low-grade withdrawal headache for a few weeks after quitting.   If you need to lose weight then you should probably eliminate any beverage with calories.  Alcohol can affect BP so it\\u2019s best to drink little to no alcohol. Some people recommend beet juice, and 3-5 cups of hibiscus tea per day.  **Sodium**\\nSome people have BP that is sensitive to sodium, and other people don\\u2019t. You may consider eating 2,000 mg or less of sodium per day, and some recommend 1,500 or less. It\\u2019s virtually impossible to stay within your sodium limits by eating prepared, processed, or canned foods. If you don\\u2019t make your own food because you don\\u2019t have the time or inclination, you\\u2019re going to exceed any sodium limit you set for yourself. **Food**\\nIf you need to lose weight, an easy starting calorie limit is to take your goal weight x 10. (You may need to adjust that up based upon activity level.) I\\u2019ll be honest with you\\u2026 you\\u2019re going to be hungry, but (hopefully) you\\u2019ll adapt to a lower calorie intake. Lose It! and My Fitness Pal are both popular calorie counting apps. Get a food scale and measuring cups so you can weigh and measure everything you eat. After a while you won\\u2019t need to weigh/measure the foods you frequently eat because you\\u2019ll learn what a serving size is. Diets are temporary. You need to permanently change the way you eat. Different systems work for different people\\u2026 find what works for you and stick with it.  Your blood test results may influence what you should eat. You might ask your Dr to refer you to a nutritionist. You don\\u2019t have to follow what they say but you might learn something from them that might help you. Everyone agrees that sugar is bad for you. Stay away from simple sugars (cookies, ice cream, etc) and limit items that break down into sugar (carbohydrates like starchy vegetables, breads, pasta, rice, etc).  Nearly everyone agrees that we should eat lots of non-starchy vegetables. Instead of adding butter and salt to them, add spices if you want to jazz up the flavor. For instance, I add Italian Seasoning to steamed broccoli. Potatoes, while starchy, have a good amount of potassium. Eating 1 plain baked or steamed potato a day is ok. Fruits are a little controversial. Some say eat as many as you want while others say eat in moderation because of all the sugars. I\\u2019m in the moderation camp of 3 or fewer fruits spread throughout the day. Ensure you get adequate potassium from food sources, but don\\u2019t overdo it. Some people with high BP have kidney damage and they can\\u2019t handle high amounts of potassium all at once. Definitely don\\u2019t take potassium supplements without talking to your Dr. A banana, potato, and beans spread throughout the day SHOULD be ok. Fiber is your friend and one thing that helps you feel full. You should probably eat 40+grams of fiber a day. Beans and vegetables are good sources as are high fiber cereals like All Bran and Fiber One.  I have 2 Tablespoons of ground flaxseed every day. I mix mine into a small amount of applesauce and have 1T in the morning and 1 in the evening.  The hard thing is to stick with the new way of eating during difficult times. Occasionally I have a splurge day and eat lots of things I normally don\\u2019t, but it\\u2019s back to the routine the next day. I just have to make sure my splurge days are rare, not frequent. One splurge day a month is my limit.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2006,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.reddit.com/r/hypertension/comments/633o78/i_am_21_with_numbers_13916090112_and_doctors_keep/\",\n          \"https://www.reddit.com/r/hypertension/comments/141vcz9/thoughtshelp_bp_read_13089_recently/\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"created_utc\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 14526,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"10/02/2021 02:15\",\n          \"13/03/2020 00:01\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"whether_distinguished\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"moderator\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I\\u2019m moving into the 3rd week of Celexa.  I really hope it settles down.  I\\u2019m going to take lisinopril in the morning instead of night.  I\\u2019ll check with the doctor if he thinks taking another dose at night would be good even though lisinopril is usually once a day dosing.  I know that takes a few weeks too but I can\\u2019t risk another mini stroke.  I\\u2019m hoping the day time dosing counteracts the BP spikes I\\u2019m having.\",\n          \"Apparently my response is too long because it won\\u2019t let me post it as one comment, so you\\u2019ll get 2 from me. Sorry. (This is 2 of 2) **Beverages**\\nBeing adequately hydrated can affect your BP. How much plain water should you drink each day? Drink as much as needed so that your urine is a light yellow color. (It is possible to drink too much water and when you do that you can lose too many vitamins, minerals, and nutrients.) Spreading it throughout the day gives your body a constant source and allows it to better process the water. You may begin to urinate more frequently when you first start drinking more water because when your body learns it will have a constant source of water, it isn\\u2019t afraid to let go of what it has stored.  Caffeine affects BP in some people but they haven\\u2019t figured out why. If you\\u2019re caffeine sensitive then you should probably eliminate it. You may have a low-grade withdrawal headache for a few weeks after quitting.   If you need to lose weight then you should probably eliminate any beverage with calories.  Alcohol can affect BP so it\\u2019s best to drink little to no alcohol. Some people recommend beet juice, and 3-5 cups of hibiscus tea per day.  **Sodium**\\nSome people have BP that is sensitive to sodium, and other people don\\u2019t. You may consider eating 2,000 mg or less of sodium per day, and some recommend 1,500 or less. It\\u2019s virtually impossible to stay within your sodium limits by eating prepared, processed, or canned foods. If you don\\u2019t make your own food because you don\\u2019t have the time or inclination, you\\u2019re going to exceed any sodium limit you set for yourself. **Food**\\nIf you need to lose weight, an easy starting calorie limit is to take your goal weight x 10. (You may need to adjust that up based upon activity level.) I\\u2019ll be honest with you\\u2026 you\\u2019re going to be hungry, but (hopefully) you\\u2019ll adapt to a lower calorie intake. Lose It! and My Fitness Pal are both popular calorie counting apps. Get a food scale and measuring cups so you can weigh and measure everything you eat. After a while you won\\u2019t need to weigh/measure the foods you frequently eat because you\\u2019ll learn what a serving size is. Diets are temporary. You need to permanently change the way you eat. Different systems work for different people\\u2026 find what works for you and stick with it.  Your blood test results may influence what you should eat. You might ask your Dr to refer you to a nutritionist. You don\\u2019t have to follow what they say but you might learn something from them that might help you. Everyone agrees that sugar is bad for you. Stay away from simple sugars (cookies, ice cream, etc) and limit items that break down into sugar (carbohydrates like starchy vegetables, breads, pasta, rice, etc).  Nearly everyone agrees that we should eat lots of non-starchy vegetables. Instead of adding butter and salt to them, add spices if you want to jazz up the flavor. For instance, I add Italian Seasoning to steamed broccoli. Potatoes, while starchy, have a good amount of potassium. Eating 1 plain baked or steamed potato a day is ok. Fruits are a little controversial. Some say eat as many as you want while others say eat in moderation because of all the sugars. I\\u2019m in the moderation camp of 3 or fewer fruits spread throughout the day. Ensure you get adequate potassium from food sources, but don\\u2019t overdo it. Some people with high BP have kidney damage and they can\\u2019t handle high amounts of potassium all at once. Definitely don\\u2019t take potassium supplements without talking to your Dr. A banana, potato, and beans spread throughout the day SHOULD be ok. Fiber is your friend and one thing that helps you feel full. You should probably eat 40+grams of fiber a day. Beans and vegetables are good sources as are high fiber cereals like All Bran and Fiber One.  I have 2 Tablespoons of ground flaxseed every day. I mix mine into a small amount of applesauce and have 1T in the morning and 1 in the evening.  The hard thing is to stick with the new way of eating during difficult times. Occasionally I have a splurge day and eat lots of things I normally don\\u2019t, but it\\u2019s back to the routine the next day. I just have to make sure my splurge days are rare, not frequent. One splurge day a month is my limit.\",\n          \"You need to go to the emergency room. Now.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I was told by my doctor anything 140/90 is when you need meds. We are doing way too much to get to 120/80. I even had a nurse come tell me ages ago that 126/84 was hypertension. We really gotta redefine hypertension here in the states. I understand that as we age BP changes. But you aren't even in your 40s, you don't have heart failure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or kidney problems to even think about getting on medications. While I'm not a doctor, I have experienced being over medicated on BP medication and it actually damaged my body. It has changed my autonomic function. Not just me but I'm finding out other people are being way over medicated. You need to have a week of average readings twice a day to start on medications and it has to be 140/90. Lowering blood pressure too much via medication is just as dangerous. Again I'm not a doctor but I can also provide sources. https://www.helloheart.com/post/high-blood-pressure-doctor-may-overmedicating https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC514035/ https://www.healthline.com/health-news/misdiagnosed-with-high-blood-pressure 136 systolic is not even high enough for medication yet doctors are doing it anyway. It's really bad to do this. Try relaxing more and go about your day. If it goes down you are fine. You may have anxiety over taking your BP most people do. Please don't stress yourself if you have no other causes or bad health conditions.\"],\n",

In fact there are many On this site who'd love to have a pressure like that! In Europe and most of the world, the cut off for hypertension is 140/90, meaning your pressure is normal. That was the cut off here in the USA until 2017 when after a single, and very flawed study, SPRINT, the cut off was lowered to 130/80, but many doctors here still follow the older 140/90 cut off to make a high blood pressure diagnosis. More importantly, even the New guidelines recommend only lifestyle changes and not medication if you are at what is now called stage 1 hypertension, 130-39, or 80-89. \\nI of course am not a doctor,you should discuss these issues  with your doctor but you have to understand that there are benefits and risks to going on medications. If your pressure is consistently high, you need to go on meds but at a pressure of 136/86, at best, I would say keep up the good work and at worst, I'd say keep monitoring your bp and if it keeps going up, then you need to consider going on medications. Bp meds come with a variety of side effects, including weight gain, low potassium (a risk for heart disease), diabetes (some bp meds raise blood sugar), and hypotension, which itself can increase the risk of strokes and heart disease as well as dizziness or fainting. The other thing most people won't tell you is that once you go on meds, you are probably on them for life, with the added problem  that your body can develop a resistance to the drug so it works less effectively or stops working altogether, meaning eventually you have to add or replace medications. When I started having high blood pressure as an adult, a nurse advised me that the longer I could wait to go On medication, the longer I could put off being on meds and dealing with the side effects and the eventual need to add/replace meds. Unfortunately I had to start on meds at the age of 39 and for 21 years my bp was fairly well controlled til I hit 60, and the med i was on stopped working. I have had to go On 2 replacement drugs that worked great, except one of those drugs, a diuretic, I had to be taken off of because my potassium was too low. The ACE inhibitor that my doc replaced it with has not worked as well and I may be going on a 3rd med soon. You see the challenges once you have to go on Bp meds.\\nI am not going to lie to you, at some point in your life you will probably have go on blood pressure medications but your current pressure does not seem to call for going on meds in the absence of some complications.

I always been very active I played football during my last high school year and it was difficult for me to pass the physical evaluations because of my hypertension.. I was put on medication then on a diet and my hypertension got better but after that life got busier when I started working and I stopped taking medication. In 2022 I went back to the doctor and my hypertension was back. I currently have a normal BMI and I know my diet isn’t the best but I try not to overeat sodium. My doctor put me on 10mg amlodipine and it helps, my blood pressure at home most of the times is below 130/80. Recently I got a new job opportunity and it required me to pass a non-dot physical, the guy did a reading (I don’t think he did it right because he had my back not supported and my arm was floating, not supported at hearth level) but he said that he got 190/80, I have never had bp this high but I get very anxious when they take my BP, especially when my job depends on it… the guy who perform a physical made me get a note from my doctor saying that I’m ok. I had to wait more time but I did get the note saying that everything is good and he’s working on my hypertension and doctor prescribed me another medication beta-blockers (metoprolol 50mg) because my BP reading was high (150/**)at the doctors’ office; this medication concerns me because all of its side effects. I had to go back to see the guy who did my physical again (I had to wait another week without work) and I managed to get a couple readings below 140/80 but he’s still tripping about my physical and won’t clear me yet. I got the note that he wanted but he keeps delaying the process which makes me more anxious because I need this job. I think I have developed white coat syndrome because of all this bad experiences. It makes me depressed to be this young and I already have all this hypertension issues, no one else in my family has hypertension… I had multiple lab test and exams and they can’t find the root of my hypertension. I rarely have any alcohol and I also don’t smoke. \\nWill I need this hypertension medication for the rest of my life ? I have been trying my best to cut down on my sodium intake and I try to stay physically active.. what can I do about this guy delaying my physical not being approved even tho my employer knows about my hypertension issues ? Now all this stress goes through me and increases my blood pressure even more… I only been on beta blockers for two days. Do I even need beta blockers ? I’m not looking for professional advice I am just seeing if someone ever experienced something like this. The chart shows my BP readings at home. Thank you'],\n",

              "  \"Hi Reddit, I'm looking for some advice / ideas about what I can look into / test for etc. regarding my ongoing hypertension. The tldr; version is I am a fit & healthy 39 year old male, non-smoker (who vary rarely drinks). My bp is currently around the 160/100 point (but this drops by 20 points post exercise for a few hours). To get me to this level I'm taking:  10mg of Ramipril  \\n8mg of Candesartan and   \\n8mg of Doxazosin (Cardura)  I was recently prescribed Spironolactone which did a number on me - I became irritable, emotional and had brain fog. I've stopped taking that one and as well as all my 'mental' issues going away, for about a week afterwards by blood pressure dropped (I was at 120/80, dropping to 100/60 after exercise). I'm now left wondering what is going on - I feel like the drop in blood pressure when I stopped it is indicative of something... I just don't know what. Does anyone have any ideas?  =========== A bit more backstory (in case it's relevant). I am 39 year old caucasian male. I'm physically very fit (I go running at least 5 days a week and average ~40km a week - my watch says I have a 'fitness age' of someone 9 years younger, so happy days) also my BMI is pretty much spot on. This isn't by accident as I used to be pretty overweight and had a sedentary life style but I managed to drop all the extra weight and have been at my ideal BMI since Jan 2022. I discovered I had high blood pressure around mid 2021 (which was part of the motivation to lose weight and taking up running etc) but dropping the weight and improving my fitness doesn't seem to have have an impact... or at least not much. I eventually went to my GP after exhausting everything I could think to try at home in terms of diet and lifestyle changes. My BP was 200/120 (and that was a 'good' day - the highest I recorded prior to that was 230/180) and I was told this was 'super high' and the only reason I wasn't being sent straight to hospital was that I seemed fine in every other respect but was started on bp meds straight away. Since then I have had Urine tests, ECG, 24 hour ECG's, Echo cardiogram, 24 hour BPM, and an MRI and more Blood tests than I can count (mainly for checking kidney function to make sure the bp meds aren't doing me too much damage) and the diagnosis is.... Primary Hypertension (which feels a lot like  'we don't know and please will you go away now' syndrome). Regarding medication, I started with Ramipil, and then tried various calcium channel blockers (which all gave me palpitations and made my ankles and feet swell to varying degrees) then added Indapamide (diuretic) which to counter this but that made my blood pressure drop too low after I'd been out for a run (almost passed out a couple of times with bp of 88/53) so then we swapped those two for Candestartan and Doxazosin and now my BP is generally in the 160/100 range unless I go for a run. Running seems to drop my blood pressure pretty consistently by about 20 (both systolic and diastolic) for a few hours and then gradually increase. I've not been able to find any info on this but that seems like a lot to me like (does anyone know if that is a normal amount for a post exercise drop?) Recently the Cardiologist prescribed Spironolactone - which turned out to be a huge mistake. For three weeks I was taking it I became increasingly irritable, emotional and generally unpleasant to be around. I was also making more mistakes at work and found it harder to concentrate. And the kicker was my blood pressure wasn't even go down. Once I had worked out the likely cause and stopped taking it the results were dramatic.  My mood improved, 'brain fog' lifted and most surprisingly my blood pressure DROPPED - and not by a small amount - for about a week my bp was in the 120/80 range, dipping down to 100/60 after I had been for a run. It was almost like my body started to overproduce something to compensate for the medication and when the medication stopped there was a flood of it... if that makes sense. Unfortunately it's started to creep back up and I'm back to where I started but when I've spoken to the GP they seemed... well not disinterested but no good ideas either. They just said they had followed the NICE guidelines and there wasn't anything else they would generally test for... not exactly a super helpful answer. The only other thing of note (I don't think it's related but mentioning just in case) is about a month ago I developed Gallstones (a couple of bad episodes but they seemed to have settled down - fingers crossed!).  So I'm turning to the internet - does anyone have any ideas of things I can encourage my GP to test for or any lifestyle or diet changes I could try to make?\"],\n",

              "  'You’re almost certainly fine.  Ideal BP is 120/80. Yours is barely above that, so, most likely your elevated readings are due to anxiety. Even mild anxiety spikes can raise blood pressure dramatically, but that is a *normal* physiological response to perceived danger, and doesn’t have the same damaging health affects as chronically high BP.  I suggest buying a blood pressure monitor. Omron is the brand I use. Talk to your doctor about your concerns over your BP, and take your blood pressure monitor with you and make sure its readings match with theirs. Then you can check your BP as often as you like. That will help you pin down your average BP, and you will see that it’s probably not actually high BP that you have, but health anxiety.  Health anxiety is very common. If you find yourself repeatedly fixating on various diseases and worrying that you have them, then Health Anxiety is probably the only real disease you have. It’s sneaky like that.  Counseling is the best treatment, along with supplementing magnesium glycinate, vitamin D, Omega-3, and full spectrum CBD.  Some brands I’ve used:  Solaray Magnesium Glycinate, 2 capsules in the morning, 2 in the evening.  I’ve recently switched to Thorne’s Magnesium Bi-Glycinate powder, which you can stir into water or juice. Had great results.  Solgar Vitamin D3 soft gels, 1000 IU. I take 3 a day.  Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega.  Lazarus Naturals High Potency Full Spectrum CBD. The dosing window of CBD is extremely wide. I require 300mg total a day, I’ve known others who got the same results from 50mg. CBD also takes several weeks to reach full effectiveness, so, don’t be surprised if you feel nothing at first.'],\n",

I did appreciate this sub, even though none of the recs worked for my hypertension because of my rare circumstance. Last bit of advice from me is don’t give up if your hypertension doesn’t respond to meds or lifestyle changes. Push your doc to do more tests. Look at other symptoms you might be having. I also had extreme fatigue, depression, anxiety, weird menstrual cycles, and unexplained weight gain. Turns out those were also caused by Cushing’s syndrome. Take care y’all. Stay strong.

Initially the only cure was to remove the kidney (which the docs and my parents did not want to do) or go on a ton of medication, which i was on for five years. eventually they developed a kidney bypass procedure in which a piece of an artery from the leg is grafted onto the kidney, eliminating the stenosis.  I had the operation performed on me when I was fifteen and it was so liberating to be free from drugs and their side effects and going to the docs!  for 24 years i had no problems with my pressure until i was 39 and started having blood pressure issues.  They tested me to see if the kidney graft had failed, but no such luck , just essential hypertension.  Recently, because my bp started going out of whack after years of treatment  they did all the tests on cortisol and aldosterone levels and other things, and all came back negative. Next week i go for another ultrasound on my kidneys and adrenal glands to see if either is a problem. Most likely, its just me getting older (62) and having to go on more medications.  Sorry for the long response but I can definitely relate to the feelings of liberation and freedom you must be feeling. best of luck to you and Godspeed'],\n",

It helped a little bit but my numbers were still slightly high. My doc ran a bunch of labs, but nothing else seemed off. She was pretty stumped but she just thought it must be genetic.  Then I got pregnant last august and my bp skyrocketed right away. My ob put me on more meds but they didn’t seem to help at all. She referred me to a high risk ob who noticed my potassium was also low. He talked with an endocrinologist who said it might be Cushing’s syndrome caused by a tumor and had them do a 24 hour urine collection. My cortisol was SUPER high, like off the charts. That’s when they did an MRI and found a tumor on my adrenal gland. the endocrinologist said it had to be removed right away. Had surgery at 22 weeks pregnant!  The tumor was successfully removed in November 2022. I was on steroids to help with cortisol withdrawal. My bp improved but became high again in the third trimester. I had to give birth early at 32 weeks.  Now it’s been about 8 weeks and my blood pressure has never been better. I can probably stop taking meds soon (I’ve been tapering and it’s still normal).  I feel so much better overall too, that tumor was causing a lot of other symptoms, like depression, fatigue, and unexplained weight gain.   All this to say: if your bp levels aren’t responding to meds or lifestyle changes, push your Dr to do more testing! Think about other symptoms you might be feeling. Get your cortisol levels checked. Don’t give up and don’t let your doctors give up! Cushing’s syndrome is rare but if this posts helps just one person who might be struggling, it’s worth it. Good luck y’all.'],\n",

A usual tiny fruit is known for its multiple benefits from the single antioxidant property. Therefore it is a potential nutraceutical with reference to disease management.\\xa0 Lemon is a potential source of vitamin C with plenty of other nutrients you might not be aware of. ### 100g of lemon has * Water: 89g\\n* Energy: 29kcal\\n* Protein: 1g\\n* Total lipid: 0.3g\\n* Carbohydrate: 9.3g\\n* Total dietary fiber: 2.8g\\n* Sugar: 2.5g\\n* Vitamin C: 53 mg\\n* Calcium: 26mg\\n* Iron: 0.6mg\\n* Magnesium: 8mg\\n* Phosphorous: 16mg\\n* Potassium: 138 mg\\n* Sodium: 2mg\\n* Vitamin E: 0.15mg ## Benefits of Lemon for High Blood pressure Hypertension is a major risk of cardiac disease, as it is impossible to ignore the rising numbers. By 2025 approximately 25% of 25-64-year-olds will have hypertension. A daily intake of citrus fruits like lemon, oranges, and grapefruit has shown an effective blood-lowering potential. According to epidemiological studies, vitamin C has been found to protect heart wall lining cells and Low-Density Lipoprotein (bad cholesterol) from oxidative stresses to reduce hypertension risks. **Lemon shows the following actions to prevent hypertension risks** **Lemon improves endothelial (heart wall) functioning.** ### 1. It acts as a potent antioxidant It is a known antioxidant that helps with blood flow and heart health. It prevents the oxidation of fatty substances in the body commonly known as cholesterol. Cholesterol is the major risk factor that disrupts blood flow by accumulating in the blood vessels.\\xa0 Here lemon prevents cholesterol oxidation and its accumulation. ### 2. It boosts your immunity One glass of lemon juice daily will improve your health and immunity. You will feel energetic, fresh, and immune to fight any infection. Having a good immune power and a healthy heart will prevent you from many diseases. ### 3. Shows diuretic action Enough amounts of lemon daily will help you to detox your body and maintain a good electrolyte balance. It has a good amount of ascorbic acid that helps in the absorption of iron from your gut and food. ## How does Lemon lower High Blood pressure? Lemon, a representative of citrus fruits, has many bioactive components such as citric acid, polyphenol, and ascorbic acid, which contribute to our health. One study concludes a reduction in systolic blood pressure in[ ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4003767/)people after lemon ingestion. Though a precise mechanism of how [blood pressure](https://sprintmedical.in/blog/blood-pressure-definition-normal-levels-symptoms-causes) is lowered by lemon is not known, scientists have given the most probable mechanism for this action. The citric acid in the lemon correlates with systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and red blood cell count. Citric acid generates calcium citrate which promotes the absorption of calcium and magnesium from food and the gut. There is a major possibility that these absorbable ions are efficiently participating in blood pressure. And hence lemon helps to secrete these ions via the kidney. The study concludes that walking and lemon ingestion show a potential effect on lowering systolic blood pressure. Daily walking for at least 20 minutes improves blood flow and energy. ## How to use lemon for high blood pressure? There is no specific standard way of adding lemon to your diet. You can enjoy lemon as you want. 1. Simply start squeezing fresh lemon juice into your food it will add richness and flavor to your dish.\\xa0 2. Make a simple lemon drink or replace your water with lemon water. You can directly add lemon to your water bottle. 3. Drink lukewarm lemon water in the morning to detox and cleanse your gut. It helps to maintain your gut health and eliminate all the toxins and excess of ions that are the probable cause of hypertension. 4. Make a drink of lemon, garlic, and ginger. Drink 1 tbsp. of this drink daily it will help to improve your lipid profile. This will eventually lower the cholesterol buildup. 5. You can make simple yet effective shikanji/nimbu paani for a quick and fresh start. Replace sugar with honey and it will become a perfect healthy drink. ## How to Make Lemon Water to Lower Blood Pressure? Simple lemon water you can make which is very effective to lower blood pressure if you drink it on a daily basis. Cut a fresh lemon in half and squeeze the juice out if it. Add this juice to lukewarm water, stir it nicely, and cool it down. You can also use your drinking water instead of lukewarm water. If you like sweets add some honey in it. Adding a small amount of ginger extract will enhance the quality of the nutritional profile of your lemon water. Drink this water on an empty stomach and feel the energy.'],\n",

Unlike white coat hypertension in which people get high readings at the doctor but normal readings at home, some people do the opposite, they get normal readings at the doctor but higher readings outside of the doctor.  Do you have a blood pressure monitor?  if not, you should buy one and take your pressures at home, if they are higher at home it could spell a problem.  As far as headaches, they could be a symptom of all kinds of things.  Now I am not a doctor so you should consult with and defer to your doctor but if you feel that he or she is not dealing with your health issues correctly, see a second one.  Good luck to you\"],\n",

However, the next guidelines probably will include beta-blockers if patients fulfill one or more of approximately 50 conditions. Notwithstanding, personally, I think there is no reason to start with a beta-blocker when there are excellent other drugs with much better documentation. Two of my favorite first-line drugs are amlodipine or losartan since both CCBs and ARBs lower the central blood pressure (the blood pressure in the aorta) more than beta-blockers and diuretics, while the peripheral blood pressure (the blood pressure measured in the arm) remains similar. In addition, the newer beta-blockers like bisoprolol or carvedilol don't have mortality trials in hypertension, while both amlodipine (Value) and losartan (LIFE) had excellent conducted trials with >15,000 and >9,000 patients, respectively. These trials have reported the efficacy and the cost/benefit in detail. There are good reasons to start beta-blockers (approximately 50 good reasons). However, if you don't have any of these conditions, I don't get why you would start with a drug without documentation when there are better choices.

I worked a lot this summer. I was working in a restaurant. The normal hours would be 40 per week, but I was doing 60hrs by choice, as I would get paid extra for the other 20 hours. At the time I thought to myself, yes, no problem, I can do this.  Some weeks passed, and I was sleeping well, eating well, I wasn't feeling tired at all. Until one day, my body gave the first sign that it was exhausted, that it didn't feel heard. I started having consequent anxiety attacks. It was hell after that... but long story short, I lost over 10kg in the last 2 months, spent all the time going to doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists... and had high blood pressure, which didn't help at all my anxiety. My highest was when I woke up in the morning, it was 156/96. To whoever is experiencing this shit because of anxiety, I feel you guys. I know it's hell. From morning to night, that's all you can think about. These fucking numbers. You don't want to eat. You don't want to exercise because you are scared that something might happen to you. But trust me, it does get better. My life is back to normal now. As of today I am 122/78 before going to bed, I am very happy and thankful. Go slowly. Start by taking some walks in the morning, 10/15/20 minutes, doesn't matter, but keep your body moving. Exercise. Ever since those attacks, I never once touched a cigarette again, or sipped one drop of alcohol. So, don't smoke, don't drink alcohol, don't eat processed sugar or foods with lots of salt. And most important of all, be thankful, of anything really, something simple as breathing, It relieves you.\"],\n",

I wanted to let you know about some peer-reviewed scientific studies in which people with high blood pressure who fasted were able to lower their pressure and get off their BP meds. Most doctors still think hypertension can’t be reversed, but in fact these studies, going back two decades, consistently and convincingly found that the great majority of hypertensive subjects who fasted under medical supervision enjoyed a substantial drop in blood pressure. In one [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11416824/) of 174 hypertensives, for example, every patient saw drops in their pressure with approximately 10 days of water fasting at a clinic. All of the patients who were on BP meds were able to go off them. Those with the worst hypertension—stage 3—got the best results, with an average drop of 60 systolic points (the top number in a BP reading). That’s not a typo: 60. Overall, the average drop for everyone in the study was 37/13, which is far beyond what the best BP pills and procedures can achieve. In fact, that’s the largest drop ever reported in the peer-reviewed scientific literature for any blood pressure therapy. Here’s [another study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12470446/) with similar findings. And [another](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35334843/), published just this year. Among the coauthors of these studies are researchers from prestigious research institutions like Cornell University and the Mayo Clinic. It’s also useful to know that multiple studies have found medically supervised fasting to be safe, for example [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29458369/). You may be wondering if there’s a catch. There is. Fasting doctors and scientists have long observed that although high blood pressure drops during a fast, it nearly always goes back up if the fasters return to the same diet they were eating before the fast. Scientists theorized—and now have strong research to back them—that diet is a leading driver of high blood pressure. After some experimenting, fasting doctors have generally found that when people switch to a diet heavy in less-processed plants, their blood pressure stays down. In this fasting [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11416824/), for example, a diet of minimally processed plants kept blood pressure down months after patients fasted. I write about all this in a few pages of my book *The Oldest Cure in the World: Adventures in the Art and Science of Fasting* (I’m Steve Hendricks). But you don’t need to buy the book to learn more. I’ve also made a 10-minute video explaining the basics that you can watch for free on YouTube: [“The Science of Fasting for High Blood Pressure.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NetOcg_5y8I) One more thing to note is that fasting doctors and scientists **strongly** recommend that people who have an illness like high blood pressure or who are taking medications or supplements of any kind shouldn’t fast on their own for more than about 18 hours. Doctors and scientists advise these people to make longer fasts only under the supervision of medical professionals trained to oversee fasts—people who, for example, know how to safely taper people off their medications as needed. (When fasting, if you’re taking BP meds, you can become hypotensive.) I hope the above information is helpful. Best wishes.'],\n",

Those trials are expensive, and the companies and government agencies that fund them haven't stepped up. That said, a few answers: The average fast in these trials is usually about 10 days. The refeeding period at the clinic is another 5 days or so. Sometimes there's a prefeeding period of a couple days. The decline in blood pressure occurred almost entirely during the fast. Very little of the decline came after the fast. A typical person loses maybe 15 pounds in a 10-day fast. That's certainly enough to start lowering blood pressure. But it's not enough to lower blood pressure by the amounts stated in the studies (e.g. 37/13 on average in one study, 60 systolic points for the stage 3 hypertensives). So most of the drop in BP appears to have been independent of weight loss. The doctors and scientists behind these studies would, I think, say that you're correct that part of what's going on is the removal of all the foods and food-like products that are contributing to high blood pressure. The continued absence of those things in the refeeding diet also appears to be critical to maintaining the drop in blood pressure after the fast. In the past, when people have experienced big drops in BP during a fast, and then go back and eat the same stuff they ate before, their BP shoots right back up.\"],\n",

Around 16, I got with a different doctor, and they started giving me amlodipine, but it never helped my blood pressure. At the time I didn’t care, so I didn’t take the medication for that long. Now, at 19 years old, my blood pressure got even higher (145-160 over 80-90). I am now on losartan and have been on it for 2-3 months now and my blood pressure is usually around 120-130 over 75-85. I’ve been in shape my whole life. Since I was a child, I have had abs, played multiple sports, worked out. But somehow and some way, I got this terrible health defect. My kidneys, blood, and heart were checked at 17, all normal. They were checked again at 19. All normal. So does anybody think they have an idea how long until blood pressure causes long term damage to one’s body from experience or by some sort of story? I’ve had it for 5 years, and still everything is functioning normally. Could be because I’m very young. I mean my brain could be fucked up but I haven’t noticed anything crazy except my stupidity.

Your current numbers on medication are fine, but the ones before were definitely high enough to cause alarm.  I’m one of the lucky people who did get eye damage from hypertension, but my bp was over 200/100 when diagnosed. The pressure was squeezing the optic nerve and preventing proper blood flow. At the time it presented as blurry peripheral vision, light spots and light sensitivity. After medication it mostly went away, but the bottom periphery on my right eye is still a bit blurry though my central vision is excellent.  I’d advice you stay on the medication and maintain healthy habits. It sounds like you’re just unlucky to have a strong genetic propensity for hypertension so it’s not that bad habits have caused it so much as you need healthy habits to keep it from getting worse.

Overly strenuous activity, like working out to exhaustion, can be dangerous when your bp is already high, but light to medium exercise is great as long as you don’t overdo it. As for food, cut down on salt, sugar and red meat. Eat more vegetables.  Calcium, potassium and magnesium can help lower your bp, maybe that’s what’s in your vitamins? Be careful with those though, don’t take too much. Some vitamins and minerals, like vit C, are water soluble so if you overconsume you just pee out the excess.

I have my old energy back, my old mental ability and capacity back, and my body feels great! I feel relaxed and stress free overall. &#x200B; Blood pressure issues: •\\tUsually high in the morning (145/95) with lower pulse rate (75-80) •\\tMuch lower in the afternoon (130/85) with higher pulse rate (80s-90s) •\\tBlood pressure is consistent regardless of sodium intake\\\\* and exercise •\\tHad to deal with muscle cramps much of my life (electrolyte issues) but electrolyte test has never demonstrated any issue. &#x200B; Medicines tried: •\\tLisinopril – this stuff worked well for me, I felt relaxed, heart rate and BP went down, but the cough and hacking side effect hit me hard, so I stopped it •\\tLosartan – made me extremely dry and kind of anxious (I am not an axious person) •\\tAmlodipine – currently taking, no side effects but does not show any real change to my BP &#x200B; Supplements & Other: •\\tOlive leaf Extract supplement – not seeing any change to BP •\\tArjuna – not seeing any change to BP •\\tBitter Melon – not seeing any change to BP •\\tPatanjali Divya Muktavati – this stuff brought my BP way down, but my nose and sinuses got stuffed up beyond belief, so I had to stop using it •\\t\\\\*Fasting – this seems to show the most improvement, on days when I fast, my BP drops •\\tBreathing exercises – tend to increase my BP, especially Wim Hof method (took the class in LA years back). My BP increase on inhales and decreases on exhales (from what I can tell).  •\\tMeditation – any impact on BP is short lived &#x200B; Thank you &#x200B;'],\n",

For me, it is usually 90 to 140 depending on the easy, medium, hard intensity cycle.  The first month, I used 130 as a caution area, but feel a bit more confident to push it to 140 lately.  Pre-diagnosis I\\'d worry less about the max pulse than I do now. More detail: On 5mg Amlodipine.  Added 12.5mg, first dosage less than 24 hours ago, so I expect I will see some kind of drop soon. I\\'m still not below 120/80 for my BP. But my resting pulse seems to be on the low side of the listed 60 to 100.  It is frequently in the 60s.   Which has me wondering if it is getting dangerously low when I sleep.  It has been as low as 57 even though, again, the BP is still in the 120 to 135 / 85 to 95 range. I\\'ve read conflicting articles on High Blood Pressure  with a Low Pulse.  The causes being wildly different.  One is your heart is in good health due to exercise.  And I do exercise quite a bit.  I only really stopped for the few months prior to diagnosis when my undiagnosed HBP was making recovery too difficult to keep the cardio up more than 2 weeks at a time.  And I was a relatively serious athlete in my youth.  Always had good endurance (until a few months ago). But I have HBP, so it is hard to say my heart is in good condition in terms of athlete status now. It mentions the BP meds (none specifically mentioned) could be a part of it.  But 57 seems low enough to start to worry.  What if the new meds have it going down to 50? Then the scary possibility that it is a sign my heart is working harder than it has to.  Which is totally at odds with the other \"cause\" that my heart is working very efficiently. One article I referenced: [https://www.healthline.com/health/high-blood-pressure-low-pulse](https://www.healthline.com/health/high-blood-pressure-low-pulse) For reference of non-resting pulse: When I do my exercise bike, I usually do interval training (finally made it back to that), where I usually have 3 basic levels repeated.  Easy (Pulse usually around 90 to 100);  Medium (Pulse usually around 100 to 120);  Pushing it (Pulse usually around 120 to 140).   And after the hard part is done and the program comes back down to easy to start the cycle over, my pulse usually goes right back down to the 90 to 100 range.'],\n",

I have zero reference as to what to expect from my doctor for a hypertension plan.  I had \"ask about a Cardiologist\" on my tablet list, but never even got around to it. Was really surprised he never once asked \"Do you have any questions?\"  In fact, it ended by him asking me to follow him.  I figured we were going to do some testing.  Instead, I followed him to the door to the lobby where he talked to his assistant briefly and then she took over basically telling me \"Ok, here are your prescriptions and take this paperwork to your Lab work tests.\"  And I was \\\\*done\\\\*.

              "  'So i\\'m a healthy 30 y/o male, work out almost every day, good body composition, eat healthy etc... but my blood pressure has ALWAYS been elevated. Usually around 135/85 sometimes got as high as 140 systolic. I\\'ve tried so many things to lower my blood pressure; saunas, beetroot powder, dash diet etc... Nothing ever had an effect, until recently i saw on this subreddit someone suggest taking potassium In the past I tried taking potassium chloride, but i damn near burned a hole in my stomach!! high concentration potassium, especially potassium chloride can cause stomach ulcers and im pretty sure i gave myself one (it\\'s since healed). so i said HELL NO to the potassium chloride, plus it tasted horrible! but i recently i read someone on here talking about potassium citrate and how it helped them lower their blood pressure. I was just about to talk to my doctor about blood pressure medications so i thought i might as well give potassium CITRATE a try. To my surprise potassium citrate was much easier on my stomach and tasted much better (however it still tastes bad when not mixed with something, i use those sugar-free drink flavoring packets and can hardly taste the potassium). And to my surprise this has basically cured my lifelong hypertension! im sitting at my desk right now with my blood pressure machine looking at 115/73, and a 114/70 earlier today!!! and its been this way since i\\'ve been taking the potassium. Couldn\\'t be more happy! Now potassium comes with some dangers you should be aware of... potassium is used in lethal injections lol! too much potassium can sent your heart into a dysrhythmia and kill you!!! if you have any sort of kidney disease you SHOULD NOT take potassium, or if you on any blood pressure medications or potassium sparing diuretics, those could cause your potassium levels to go too high and be dangerous but from my research if you\\'re a healthy individual you should be able to take potassium responsibly with no issues, you\\'re body will process it and pee it out just like it does with sodium. BUT always consult with your doctor before getting on a new supplement, especially potassium. That being said i\\'ve found what works best for me is to take half a TEASPOON of potassium citrate powder (which comes out to about 1000mg of actual potassium), put it in a 22 oz waterbottle with a little bit of sugar-free drink flavoring, fill it with water, and drink that down 3 times a day. That gives me about 3000mg of potassium per day (normal RDA for potassium for an adult is around 3,500–4,700 mg per day). So unless you are already getting large amounts of potassium from your diet, or you have a kidney disorder OR on certain medications, i don\\'t see adding 3,000mg of potassium to your diet being dangerous, but again, consult with a doctor first If you want to research the reason behind how potassium works to lower blood pressure you can just youtube search \"potassium blood pressure\" and some good videos will pop up. It\\'s definitely working for me so i figured i\\'d share it with the community as I probably wont be on this subreddit anymore since blood pressure appears to no longer be an issue for me Also of note is that this probably wont work for all people. I would not be surprised to see people who aren\\'t active or have a high body mass index NOT benefit much from this as those issues would probably need to be addressed first and foremost. Anyways hope this helps someone :) tldr; I\\'m healthy in almost every way, still had hypertension most of my life, tried everything, stumbled upon potassium citrate, tried it, IT WORKED, but be careful as having too high of potassium levels in your blood could potentially be deadly edit; I should probably clarify the potassium I bought was in bulk powder form, not pill form &#x200B; &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/ee0ntwepkb471.jpg?width=2548&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b351d633c377ceaedd9173eb4fb4a1754d6881b8'],\n",

I went to the ER with 220/??? (Paramedic reading) and 201/98 (ER bed first reading).  It was a spike, not my normal BP.  But you should simultaneously relax that what you have is definitely survivable, but also take action so it will be survivable. And if your doctor can't get you an appointment in under 6 weeks (my case), then don't be afraid to use Urgent or Emergency Care if it gets over 180/120 (either or).  Or if you are feeling dizzy, numb, short of breath, chest pains, etc. Even if all your doctor does is tell you to rest/water/diet/exercise/monitor, that's still a good thing.  At least you had a medical professional determine that (and hopefully guide). But don't freak out.  I know it is hard to not freak out, but really practice slowing stress spikes down. I mostly try to sit down on a firm chair, legs uncrossed, both feet on the floor, close my eyes and just concentrate on my breathing.  Essentially what I do before taking a BP reading.  I don't know how to actually meditate, so I do that. I'd if nothing, drink a lot of water, sleep 8 hours (or try to) and go out for daily walks.  Those are probably the easiest things to start immediately.  The walks are not only good for the cardio, but also getting fresh air and Vitamin D (sunlight).\"],\n",

That not being the case: 145/93 is hypertension, yes, but it’s not that bad. Especially as most of the world considers 140/90 to be the low end of high. Why am I so nonchalant? Because I’ve been hypertensive since 16, back when the US used the same chart and for most mid my life (47 now) the aim was to average 134/84. Which, being a med student, per today’s US charts is still bad and I should be pretty damaged, right? But I’m not.  So, I’m assuming they would never prescribe BC pills to a hypertensive person, hence you’re only looking at, at most, 2 years of elevated and/or hypertension readings, right? AND it’s been caught, AND they seem to think it might be in part to stress. So that’s pretty good too, right? Maybe you haven’t studied stress and anxiety yet? It doesn’t have to be situational. It could be your life right now AS A MED STUDENT is overall stressful and has elevated your BP. And BC pills will account for a few mmhgs. And then bad diet and exercise (that was me in grad school) doesn’t help.  So, it’s totally okay and it sounds like you can make some lifestyle changes to help lower your BP (start with diet, exercise, and meditation—for the stress bit, my doc also recommends yoga…remove NSAIDs and caffeine and alcohol; save removing your BC as a last ditch effort as that can cause more stress and anxiety, depending on what you’re taking it for, than staying on it and doing everything else.) Start easy: monitor your BP the way your doc has instructed. Start drinking lots of water if you don’t already. Watch your sodium intake. Move more (at least 30 min/day, walking counts). Cut out extra caffeine (I still have my morning tea and the needed afternoon cup.)  It’s doable. The important thing is you know now. Don’t beat yourself up about it, it happens. I hope this helped.'],\n",

I freely admit that I have health anxiety and get very stressed over health related matters. I’m a 28 year old male, thin build (about 9st 5lbs), eat a relatively healthy diet and keep quite physically active through a lot of walking. Whenever I do a blood pressure reading on the monitor, the first reading I get is somewhere around 140/95 (not horrific, but far from ideal). I get quite tense because of my health anxiety which I can tell because my heart rate, which is normally 60-70 when sitting quickly shoots up to over 90. After a couple of readings, my BP will generally fall to around 120/90. Then if I sit with the monitor for a while and continue to take readings, it will eventually fall to somewhere around 115/80 (even getting as low as 98/72 once). Sometimes this will happen very quickly and sometimes it will take much longer, even perhaps taking 20 minutes or so. If I go away and do something else and then come back and take another reading, it starts high and I have to bring it down again in the same way. So, what is my real blood pressure? Is it the lower reading because I’ve calmed down after initially feeling anxious, or is it the higher reading because that’s the one I got when I first take a measurement? I plan to discuss it with a GP, but would be grateful for advice on whether I genuinely have a blood pressure issue, or this is just part of my anxiety. Has anyone encountered a similar problem? For context: three years ago, before I developed anxiety, my blood pressure at the doctor's was 118/78 and I haven't changed weight or lifestyle significantly since then.\"],\n",

However I also bought a blood pressure cuff for home use a while back and the readings are almost always on the high side ranging from 130-160, almost never under 130. \\n \\nInterestingly the diastolic is also rather low , ranging from 50-70, so a pretty wide pulse pressure. \\nCombined with my very low resting heart rate of around 40-50 (lowest was around 35) it results in very strongly visible pulsations of the aorta through my abdominal wall, as well as my foot and carotid pulses and I often feel my pulse throughout my whole body when being in a static position like sitting or lying down, and my phone is shaking in sync with my pulse when I'm holding it in my hand when laying down . I also hear my heart pumping when laying my head on a pillow. Hyperthyroidism and pheochromocytoma seem unlikely due to the low HR, and only attributing it to anxiety doesn't seem fair because oftentimes when I'm measuring at home (multiple times) I feel relaxed. What could be the reason for those high readings for my age?\\nI do  take potassium  so I wouldn't attribute it to that .\"],\n",

Back the  lab was fine but increased cholesterol (not severely, but it was like 230 total I think). Tsh was normal and t3/4 were on the high end of normal. We did a holter ECG and it was fine apart from a partial right bundle branch block, which may explain the lower HR. In the ultrasound there was no hypertrophy altho that may be different now after 4 years nor were there valve abnormalities (wide pulse pressure > aortic valve  stenosis?).  Rr was like 180 when he measured it but I remember being very nervous about it back then, because of that we did a exercise ECG which was stopped bc RR reached 230.  I plan on booking an appointment with a GP or cardiologist, but it often takes a few weeks to even months to get one. I had blood drawings and blood pressure takings afterwards as well when donating blood , but  they only do a very basic blood work. HB was once low but that was fixed after taking iron supplements. \\nOne hour ago I took 20mg propranolol which I have for stage fright and now my BP is at 121/62 (right arm was 130) which is good. The dosage is low enough that I don't worry about my HR.  So  it looks like it's not medication resistant high BP.  But I'm also about to hit the bed so that might contribute as well (dipper? :D).  I just don't feel well about it when by BP readings are too high 19 times out of 20. That shouldn't be the case at my age imo and with me being at normal weight and moderately active.\\nI'm also really prone to sweating a lot, to soft stools and jitteriness which all sounds like hyperthyroidism if it wasn't for the bradycardia lol, which makes it look like a lot is pointing towards anxiety haha. But I'm not buying it that it's only due to that. Yes, the readings in the doctor's office were high due to white coat hypertension but I'm not overly health anxious and  when I'm measuring multiple times at home when I'm relaxed then the value shouldn't stay *as* high  ...\\nAlso noticing strong pulsations when relaxed (and not even thinking about measuring), hearing my pulse when laying down  all sound like high BP as well .\"],\n",

Normal is what good and stage 2 is the worst with pretty much being uncontrolled high blood pressure and being super high like anything over 140/90 all the time. Medication can help to control high blood pressure and reduce the effect of it as well by keeping the hypertension in check. With seeing a doctor and getting medication and changes in lifestyle can greatly improve blood pressure. The changes in lifestyle that can be made are diet, exercise, weight lost, and a reduction in stress will all help in reducing high blood pressure. One easy way to improve the diet is by not adding or eating foods high in salt.

I am not a doctor so the things I write should not replace advice from your doctor or give a diagnosis, but hopefully I can still be of some help. According to Lewis’s Medical Surgical Nursing textbook, hypertension is when “blood pressure is elevated (higher than) the normal rate which is <120/80” (Harding, Kwong, Hagler, Reinsch, pg. 681, 2020). For example, an elevated blood pressure is along the lines of 120-129/<80. Hypertension does actually come in two stages, stage 1 and stage 2. Stage 1 ranges from 130-139/80-89 and stage 2 ranges from >140/>90. Blood pressure can fluctuate and to get a better reading it is best to be checked twice on the same hand after 30 minutes of the initial check to get the most accurate reading. The causes of hypertension (high blood pressure) can either be from primary or secondary causes. Primary cause of hypertension is when there is no actual cause and secondary is when hypertension is caused by another health condition that you currently have, or it can be genetically linked. Some signs and symptoms of hypertension are but not limited to severe headaches, fatigue, confusion, chest pain, difficulty breathing, irregular heartbeat, etc. There are different ways to treat hypertension depending on the cause of it. Medications can be a way to treat hypertension given the severity of it. Overall there are other ways to treat hypertension especially if it is just elevated and is a recent health concern. Some other ways to treat hypertension is lifestyle changes, limit the intake of sodium and alcohol, increase in physical activity. One way to manage blood pressure would be to one monitor blood pressure throughout the day to see if any lifestyle activities that are performed throughout the day effect your blood pressure. It is best to have a blood pressure monitor at home on hand. Reduce sodium intake and alcohol/tobacco usage. Implementing lifestyle changes and diet will help. I would recommend following up with your primary health care physician if you see that there is no change in your blood pressure after implementing the changes.

High blood pressure can have many different reasons and/or you could also be receiving false readings. If taking a blood pressure at home make sure that the cuff is level with your heart and if taking a couple blood pressures try waiting at least five minutes in-between blood pressures. It also depends on what you are doing at the time of taking the blood pressure and your mood can affect it as well. The best practice is to try and take your blood pressure twice a day, once in the monitor and once at night and see how much it varies.  Now like I said I am a student and not a doctor but if the high blood pressure continues it might help to talk to a doctor about this issue. If any questions please let me know.

I have found the following information to answer your question relating to, “Do I have high blood pressure? Are my readings bad or good? Could my high readings at doctor’s office be due to walking to the chair? Has anyone else had high blood pressure at a young age? According to the CDC (2020), \"Blood pressure is the pressure of blood pushing against your arteries\\' walls. Arteries carry blood from the heart to other parts of the body. Blood pressure normally rises and falls throughout the day, but it can damage the heart and cause health problems if it stays high for a long time. Hypertension, also called high blood pressure, is blood pressure that is higher than normal\". Hypertension categorized as either primary \"essential\" or secondary hypertension. \"Essential hypertension\" has no exact cause but is developed gradually as one age. An underlying condition causes secondary hypertension.   [https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/facts.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/facts.htm) Here are the new guidelines and measurements enforced in the year 2017 by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association to evaluate hypertension. When it comes to hypertension or high blood pressure, it is essential to understand the common risk factors such as 1.   Age 2.  Race 3.  Family history  4.  Being overweight 5.  Not being physically active 6.  Tobacco use 7.  Excessive salt consumption. According to Mayo Clinic (2018), many patients with elevated blood pressure will not show any signs or effects, particularly though levels of blood pressure exceed excessively high. However, few show symptoms like headache, facial flushing, dizziness, fainting, visual disturbance, and nosebleeds. It is also advised by the American Heart Associate (2018) to monitor blood pressure at home, so during doctor visits, you can compare your results with the result of the physician. Please remember that I am a student and not a doctor. Please follow the advice of your primary care physician. I can answer the questions, but my information does not replace what your primary care physician has stated.  Reference: CDC, (2020, February 25). Facts About Hypertension.

Try to manage stress/anxiety/anger. Assuming you're a college student and/or working (or not working) during this pandemic, stress will more than likely be a factor that's keeping your pressure high.

I have trouble staying asleep, so I'm trying to at least go to bed earlier than 11pm and wake up at a consistent time. I'm still working on this because sleep is a big issue for me. But I notice that on days when I got good sleep the night before, my anxiety is easier to manage and my blood pressure is also a bit lower. This is what is encouraging and motivating me to get more sleep. If it's possible for you, I would recommend trying to establish good sleep habits and getting at least 7-8 hours of rest per night.

I read quite a lot trying to find a \"higher\" normal BP range.My HR normal is around 40 (totally healthy as far as i have gone through dozens of tests), so i thought, why not my BP \"normal\" is just higher, and it is benign?  I got that question, because as soon as my BP was in controlled range (through meds) i started having some very slight side-effects, noticable only while i heavily train. So i thought maybe im just \"made\" to function better with higher BP. However, after a lot of  searching in dr. Google, and talking with various cardiologists, i confirmed there is no such thing as benign BP over 130/90, not even in ultra rare cases.  There is no such thing,\"for me  the healthy range is higher, and im good with it.\" This is just denying the facts.  BP over 130/90 is a major risk factor for EVERYONE.'],\n",

When I first saw my dr I was having heart palpitations and had a high reading so went straight onto meds. About 2 weeks later I ended up in hospital with a hypertensive crisis (240/180). At that point I was the fittest I'd been in my life. Perfect BMI, ate very well. Did IF (just 16/8). Trained 3-4 times very intense per week and 2 times moderate. Lead an active lifestyle. I was 36. I started trying all kinds of things to get my numbers down. I added running at one stage and my average resting heart rate went down from 61 to around 51 average, but no significant change in BP.  For some reason I didn't think reducing salt was necessary. Some anecdote I picked up and wanted to believe. That was bloody stupid. Last year I greatly reduced my salt intact and almost overnight my average numbers went down 10 points! Basically from 142/92 to 132/82 . I felt like such a stubborn idiot.  I've done IF on and off for the last 5 years and have seen no impact on my numbers when I not on a fasting break. In summary I dont think fitness or HR has had much impact on my numbers,  but I'm not going to let myself get unfit to really test. As with most of our hypertensive friends we just lost a little battle of the genes. Give meds a try if your dr recommends them, you cant outrun this one, just bad bloody luck. Finally,  try cutting down salt as low as pos for a month and see what happens. Much love and respect to you and yours. Chur\"],\n",

Your systolic is high, but it could be that you're predisposed to high systolic numbers. Does anyone in your family have high BP? As far as vertigo goes, it's hard to say. HBP is normally symptomless unless you get extremely high (hypertensive crisis) ie, 180/120 or higher, and at that point they'd have you on calcium or sodium channel blocking meds, as well as ARB or ACEI. (angiotensin receptor blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, respectively).  Vertigo is many times, idiopathic. If I recall correctly, there's a condition known as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Basically translates to vertigo/dizziness that occurs with sudden or awkward head movements. Sometimes a completely normal head movement, yet something gets triggered, and you get an attack of vertigo. As far as it's relation with blood pressure, one would get dizzy with low blood pressure, or a condition known as benign orthostatic hypotension. This occurs when rising quickly from a prone or supine position, causing your blood pressure to abruptly drop, causing dizziness, graying vision, and muffled hearing for a minute or two until bp returns to normal.  \\nI'm on Lisinopril 10mg, my BP is due to stress, my initial diagnosis of HBP was with a bp of 155/90.

I have anxiety attacks every time I’m at the doctors (my pulse was 139 and has been as high as 157 at the doctors while it’s usually around 70 before I go to bed), and deal with anxiety a lot at home. Most of the time my doctors get a bit alarmed at my BP and heart rate and my mother (she still goes to most of my doctors appointments staying in the waiting room with me knowing how winded up I get) always tells them it’s my anxiety and that there’s nothing wrong with me. My doc ordered me to keep track of my blood pressure for a few weeks and go get blood work done. We took my BP twice yesterday early on (around 11 AM) and got readings of around 140/95. We then did it again later (around 3 PM) and it was down to 124/82, which is still high for my age. I’ve had a pretty piss poor diet my entire life, consisting of high salt foods (lots of processed foods as well) and very little vegetable intake. I always “balanced” this out by being very active, but since graduating high school a little less than two years ago my activity level has been low and I’ve gotten quite out of shape (5’8 weighing 167, BMI over 25 for the first time in my life.) I also vaped pretty heavily for around a year and a half, which I’ve began to cut out since around the start of January. My family doesn’t really have a history of early onset health problems. My grandmother lived to be 68 before dying of COPD (big time smoker even after diagnosed), my mother is extremely healthy despite smoking for 20+ years (quit around 8 years ago), my grandparents on my fathers side are still alive at 75+ (and grandma was a smoker up to 70), while my dad is 58 and doing alright as far as I know (don’t see him much.)  I have a lot of free time at this point in my life as I don’t work and take most of my college classes online, so I plan to get a lot of exercise in everyday in some form (playing ball at the basketball courts, running in the park, etc). Also plan on cutting the salty shit out of my diet for the most part (Id guess my sodium intake is around double the suggested limits, if not more). I’ve let myself go and know I need to do better. My question is this: I don’t know much about the science of blood pressure. How much can anxiety effect it? How much of an impact can I expect from daily exercise and cutting my salt intake in half (or more)? Have I already f***ed up to the point that I should expect heart problems as I age? As someone who deals with pretty horrible anxiety, I can’t help but feel as if this is the end of the world... it’s just how I’m wired. Maybe it’s for the better so I’ll get my act together.

My doc keeps insisting I look into things to calm my thoughts.  From meditative breathing (lots of stuff on the internet about this, but simply inhale and exhale while telling yourself you\\'re inhaling and exhaling to keep yourself from thinking about ALL THE THINGS going on...it slows your heart rate and focuses you...some days this is much harder to do than others) to yoga - which I haven\\'t looked into at all...cuz I\\'m not really a yoga person. When to take your readings: Only do it once a day.  Your BP fluctuates throughout the day.  Pick a time in the AM (right after getting up) or in the evening (as part of your going-to-bed ritual) where you can sit for 10-15 minutes, calmly, following all the instructions in the manual and taking a few readings (I take a bunch...usually around 4-ish, waiting a few minutes in between) and log them all down.  From what you\\'ve posted it\\'s already obvious that you are getting lower readings at home, so you are already winning here. To get the numbers into a better range: #1 home monitors should not be used to diagnose...so here is the hard part, it /could/ be that your 141/92 at home is actually 121/72...because home monitors aren\\'t as accurate as the cuff/stethoscope method (per my doc).  SO keep that in mind.  What you want to see are trends.  Ideally when you take your two or three readings you\\'ll note the first one is higher than the second one...etc as you either get used to the reading and/or you get relaxed/used to having pressure put on your arm. Yes! keep/restart exercising. Salt: It\\'s actually sodium you want to cut, which is in everything - read all the labels.  And ideally you want to have no more than 2,000 mgs/day (this is a TINY amount...most people have 6x the daily \"limit\" if you\\'re eating a highly processed food diet).  Cut all the energy drinks and chips and you\\'re halfway there.  Anything from a can or frozen will have a lot of sodium.  I\\'m not saying stop altogether...but you decide where/how you\\'re going to spread out that limit.  Ideally add in fresh fruit to snack on...or unsalted almonds in small amounts (I miss chips...crunchy things only help a little...but it\\'s better than the alternative. Water: Drink more.

There was a paper published by Chinese doctors(i think) that suggestsed that ARBs and ACE-I, two common types of hbp meds, could mkae it easier for people to get COVID and develope complications because these meds may cause an increase of ACE-II receptors on cells, which is the receptor COVID uses to get in. This conclusion was reached after seeing that patients that were on these meds did worse than most patients. However, this paper is inconclusive because people with hbp tend to be older and/or have other health problems, so you can't really pin the blame only on ARBs and ACE-Is. There's also some people who suggest that ARBs and possibly ACE-I could lower the risk of severe lung injury. This comes from the observation that patients with SARS that were taking these meds suffered less long term damage to their lungs.  A theory suggests that the increase of ACE-II receptors makes you more subseptible to getting the virus, but since you have so many instances of it entering your cell, it gets overwhelmed and collapses, making it really hard for the virus to reproduce. Take into account that both of those theories are hardly proven and need more testing, so take everything with a grain of salt. The consensus from cardiology associations around the world is that there's no reason to stop taking hbp meds and that doing so might put you in more danger.\"],\n",

About two years ago I (28, F) suddenly developed high blood pressure (I was in the midst of ongoing treatment for an unrelated medical issue, so I was having my blood pressure taken frequently over a period of months and can pinpoint when it started to climb). I was 26 at the time, and had no risk factors that I am aware of- not a smoker, not overweight, balanced diet, moderate exercise, no anxiety, no family history.  Doctors were very perturbed to see my diastolic in the 105 range seemingly out of nowhere, and ordered a whole battery of tests- thorough bloodwork, echocardiogram, ultrasound of the kidneys, sleep study, probably others I can’t even remember now. All came back completely normal, and eventually my doctor gave up on looking for a cause and just wrote it off as basically being random.  It took a while and a few adjustment to get my blood pressure to come down to normal levels on medication, but I got there. About six months ago I switched to a pregnancy-safe medication, as I hope to start trying for a baby within the year. Though that seemed to work for a while, recently my diastolic has been climbing back to the 95 range, even after doubling the dosage.  Obviously I’m going back to the doctor to discuss this latest development, but I’m just wondering if anyone knows any further tests I can request or causes I could explore.

I feel extremely drowsy, have all day chills, chest pain and the left side of my body aches and then it will switch to the right side.  Prior to taking this three meds I was just taking Propranolol and it didn’t do anything for my blood pressure, but I experienced no side effects whatsoever. I’ve tried many two blood pressure medicine combos and my reading were the same as just taking one medication. It seems like taking 3 is my only answer to having normal blood pressure, but can’t stand these side effects!!

              "  \"*World Hypertension Day (17th May)*   \\n## What is Hypertension? Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a prevalent health concern affecting millions of people worldwide. It is a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Recent research has shown that balancing the body's endocannabinoid system (ECS) can play a significant role in regulating hypertension. This article will explore the role of the ECS in hypertension management without mentioning[ CBD](https://www.budandtender.com/collections/premium-uk-cbd-oil/products/bud-and-tender-10-cbd-oil-10ml) (which is a fantastic ECS supplement). https://preview.redd.it/54aqoab0uc0b1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0868eb1bd2b62784dd72d721596b34b6d827a2d ## Understanding the Endocannabinoid System The endocannabinoid system is a complex cell-signalling system found in the human body. It plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis – the body's ability to maintain internal stability despite external changes. The ECS is composed of three main components: endocannabinoids, receptors, and enzymes.  \\n1. Endocannabinoids: These are naturally occurring compounds similar in structure to plant-derived cannabinoids. The two primary endocannabinoids are anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG).  \\n2. Receptors: Endocannabinoids interact with receptors found throughout the body. The two main types of receptors are CB1, predominantly found in the brain and central nervous system, and CB2, mainly located in immune cells and peripheral tissues.  \\n3. Enzymes: Enzymes are responsible for breaking down endocannabinoids once they have fulfilled their function. The two primary enzymes are fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which breaks down anandamide, and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), which degrades 2-AG. https://preview.redd.it/gvppssv4uc0b1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb1810588405d80a87cfc3d0d87516840dc93647 ## The Role of the Endocannabinoid System in Hypertension Emerging research suggests that the ECS plays a vital role in regulating blood pressure. It does so through various mechanisms, including modulating vascular tone, inflammation, and oxidative stress. The following are some ways the ECS helps regulate hypertension:  \\n**1. Vascular Tone:** The ECS has been found to influence the constriction and dilation of blood vessels. Endocannabinoids like anandamide can bind to CB1 receptors, causing vasodilation and reducing blood pressure. Furthermore, the ECS can also interact with other signalling systems, such as the nitric oxide pathway, to promote vascular relaxation.  \\n**2. Inflammation:** Chronic inflammation is a significant contributor to hypertension. The ECS can modulate immune responses and reduce inflammation by activating CB2 receptors found in immune cells. By doing so, it can help alleviate hypertension caused by inflammatory processes.  \\n**3. Oxidative Stress:** Oxidative stress results from an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to neutralise them. This imbalance can damage blood vessels and contribute to hypertension. The ECS has antioxidant properties that can help combat oxidative stress and protect blood vessels, thus helping to maintain healthy blood pressure levels. ## Balancing the Endocannabinoid System To harness the potential benefits of the ECS in regulating hypertension, it is essential to maintain its balance. Here are some ways to support a balanced ECS:  \\n**1. Diet:** Consuming a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as those found in fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts, can help support endocannabinoid production. Additionally, consuming foods containing natural compounds that can interact with the ECS, like flavonoids found in fruits and vegetables, may also be beneficial.  \\n**2. Exercise:** Engaging in regular physical activity has been shown to increase endocannabinoid levels, contributing to a balanced ECS and improved cardiovascular health.  \\n**3. Stress Reduction:** Chronic stress can disrupt the ECS, leading to imbalances. Practising stress-reduction techniques, such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises, can help maintain a balanced ECS and support overall cardiovascular health. &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/gfk6jt1buc0b1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d248e4282df18b132e572850d7111b8763cae7fc ## Conclusion The endocannabinoid system plays a crucial role in regulating hypertension by modulating vascular tone, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Maintaining a balanced ECS through diet, exercise, and stress reduction can potentially contribute to improved blood pressure management and overall cardiovascular health. Further research is needed to fully understand the therapeutic potential of the ECS in treating hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions.

My numbers were around 160/100. I am a 30 year old overweight male.  Since I found this out I made several changes which I hope may be able to help some of you.  I cut out added salt completely. What I mean by this is: I did not add any salt to things like vegetables, meat, rice etc. however I did continue to eat spice rubs with salt already in.  I ate a lot more fruit and vegetables. Spinach was one of the easiest things I’ve been able to add to my diet. You can just chuck it in anything. Pasta, curry, eggs, sandwiches. Easy.   I became more active. Everyday I will go for a little walk or jump on my exercise bike for 30 mins.  Easier said than done but I became less stressed and anxious. I believe this was hugely in part to my lifestyle changes. Which came with the bonus of losing weight. Around 10lb in 3 weeks.  My blood pressure is now around 120/70. Still a little high but on the right track.

So basically, I had high blood pressure spikes maybe each 2 months in past 3 years. Then I developed tahycardia, i dont know why, but always when my bp is high, i got 120+ hr. After 2 years of going to hospitals, i went to private doctor, he gave me medications for tahycardia, beta blockers and propafenon, that was 2-3 months ago, since than thank God, I didnt have any problems with random tachycardia or tachycardia connected with high bp. Also doctor gave me blood pressure med, but my blood pressure still raise sometimes and i need to take different medication to lower it.

Few days ago it jumped again, 150/105, i feel dizzy when this happens. I did blood tests, xray, stress test, thanks God everything is fine.

              "  '\\nQ: Is there a relationship between my blood pressure levels and my blood sugar levels?\\nA: This is a serious and important question that often gets lost in the fray of multiple providers delivering fragmented care for a person with multiple conditions. The short answer is absolutely ‘Yes’! Now, let’s unpack this relationship so you can advocate for your best healthcare outcomes. How Your Body Regulates Glucose\\nLet’s first review some basics about blood sugar (glucose). The glucose in your blood serves as a primary source of energy for all the cells in your body. There are other molecules your body can make for fuel if needed, like ketones, but we’ll keep the focus on glucose here for simplicity. Your body has sensors throughout it to determine if you are at the correct blood glucose level. In people without diabetes, this level is typically between 70 and 120 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter). There are multiple hormones that either activate or go quiet as needed to protect this glucose level. If the level goes too low, your body might release catecholamine hormones (commonly known as adrenalin hormones) to trigger an increase in the level of glucose in the blood. If blood glucose goes too high, your body will release insulin and other hormones to correct the level back down to an appropriate range. People with diabetes don’t lose the ability to raise or lower their blood sugar levels; rather, the hormones that serve to keep blood glucose in the correct range don’t function correctly, and the sensors that assess the glucose level are also often impaired. How Your Body Regulates Blood Pressure\\nA similar set of processes apply to maintaining a healthy blood pressure level. In many ways, keeping your blood pressure in a good range is even more critical than keeping your blood glucose in a good range. Your body has a myriad of ways to “make” more blood sugar as well as making alternative sources of energy like ketones. But we don’t have any way to “make” more blood pressure. The body can protect blood glucose levels much better than it can protect blood pressure. If we are experiencing low blood volume, we can’t add more instantly. If we don’t have enough blood, we will pass out and this is very dangerous to the brain and body long term. With limited options for raising blood pressure, the body relies on the same hormones that get activated when blood glucose is low—catecholamine, or adrenalin, hormones—to affect this change. Catecholamines tighten up our blood vessels, making it harder for the heart to pump the blood through our arteries, which raises blood pressure. If blood pressure is too high, on the other hand, the body wants to remove blood in order to reduce the overall volume in our vessels and make it easier for the heart to pump the blood through our arteries. To accomplish this, nitric oxide is released to expand (dilate) blood vessels and reduce the pressure against our heart. When the blood vessels in the kidney expand, it causes them to release more water in order to lower blood pressure. This effect is known as diuresis, or the removal of fluid. These are just a few of the ways that we have to control blood pressure, and they are the most common. People with hypertension, a condition in which blood pressure is elevated, don’t lack the ability to control their blood pressure. But like the person with diabetes, their sensors are impaired and their response to high or low blood pressure isn’t always on the mark. How Blood Sugar Affects Blood Pressure\\nHow are these two systems connected? Insulin, which plays a role in managing blood glucose, has an unfortunate relationship with nitric oxide production in blood vessels. It blocks the ability of the body to make nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is important to blood vessels because it is one of the very few ways to expand the size of the blood vessels and lower blood pressure. If a person with diabetes is using insulin, this severely impairs the ability of the body to lower blood pressure via nitric oxide production, in turn increasing the risk of high blood pressure. In situations where the blood pressure is too low, the catecholamine response described above doesn’t discriminate, and blood sugar will also rise as a result. The same is true if the blood sugar goes too low; the catecholamine response is the first thing that the body uses to compensate, and this will raise blood pressure in the aftermath. This is how low blood sugar or low blood pressure can cause the other to go high. It is important to realize that some medications that lower blood pressure or blood glucose will override any natural protections you have and trigger these events as well. Bottom line: If you are living with diabetes, high blood pressure, or both, it’s important to closely monitor BOTH your blood sugar and your blood pressure in tandem to avoid harming one when you treat the other.'],\n",

              "  \"Hello, everyone! My name is Mary, an experienced Medical-Surgical registered nurse and currently a BSN student. I wanted to share with you all quite a bit of information about hypertension. I have noticed in the past few weeks that there have been a few concerns about how to properly take blood pressure readings. I wanted to share this image I have created to ensure you all have been taking a correct blood pressure reading (I apologize if the image is too large): [\\\\(MA, 2022\\\\)](https://preview.redd.it/745igm8w7mb91.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6eccc1fa237c2895b2b53c9cf8cab09150ce1ba) To further explain the importance of each bullet point, these are the reasons behind them: * If a blood pressure is immediately taken after some type of activity, your heart is actively working to accommodate, so the blood pressure will be elevated. (Fluid retention, such as urinary retention, and dehydration can also cause high/low blood pressures! -- so stay hydrated! :) )\\n* Arm position must be at a heart level and rested. Do not clench your hand.\\n* Crossing your legs or ankles will also increase your blood pressure because your blood circulation is fighting against further resistance; therefore, like your hand, all extremities must be at a resting position.\\n* Improper cuff placement and fitting can cause incorrect readings. Too loose of a fitting will show a low blood pressure reading; respectively, too tight of a fitting will result in a high blood pressure. Additionally, there should not be any redness or marks left on the skin after taking a blood pressure. For a further visual, the American Heart Association has provided a video in how to take a proper blood pressure:  [AHA - How to monitor your blood pressure at home (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAwliNWe1bI) . To end my presentation, I would recommend to keep a journal of blood pressure and heart rate readings for at least for 1 x week, especially before taking any blood pressure medications. This helps establish your “normal” baseline  and gives your physician a better idea in adjusting/changing meds, if needed. If you find this information helpful and/or have additional general questions regarding this topic, please post below and I will be happy to answer. Please do not post personal hypertensive issues here as this will reflect my project. :) I also have more information that I would love to share with you all, but let's see how this goes and I'm more than happy to give additional presentations.

              "  'TL;DR I\\'m concerned about consistent high blood pressure and don\\'t really know what to do. All suggestions/help appreciated. My (43F) \"concerns\" started around the beginning of 2020, although I do have higher readings that go back before then, but attributed them to white coat hypertension. Background: At the beginning of 2020, I switched psychiatrist because my old one left the practice. The new one would not prescribe me adderall anymore and one reason he gave is because of a high blood pressure reading he saw (he also would not recommend anything else except a different depression medicine at the time. i still think he was bs\\'ing me into switching to a med he was getting a kickback for, especially because my old meds had been working great and helping me). Still, i wanted to follow up on the blood pressure and went to my family doctor with a week\\'s worth of readings i had taken at home. These readings ranged from 130\\'s-150\\'s/80\\'s-90\\'s. He wasn\\'t worried and to be honest neither was I. I was also on birth control (yaz) and oral cancer meds (sprycel), which can raise blood pressure. Now, my blood pressure is staying around the 150\\'s-160\\'s/100-105 regularly at home. I also seem to be getting more frequent headaches but not tracking them. My bp is regularly taken at my oncologist\\'s office and no one there has suggested seeking help.  My husband thinks if there was a problem, then the oncologist would say something.  Recently, I was taken off the cancer meds due to a pleural effusion found on my lungs.  I have been off of those for several weeks now and no change in blood pressure. I don\\'t drink or smoke at all and never really have (had like maybe 5 drinks in my lifetime, all many years ago). I know I could stand to lose at least 20 lbs, i think 145 lbs would be a good weight for me (currently 5\\'3\" 165lbs). I am active but not consistent with it. I try, but even a basic 20-40 minute walk wears me out. I also have developed tendonitis in my hip from the antibiotics given to fix the pleural effusion...so working through that and hope to have it \"not hurting\" before Thanksgiving. There is a ton of stress in my life. I restarted seeing a therapist a few months ago to help with this, but other than that and trying to exercise more I don\\'t really know how else to lower stress.  If anyone has any suggestions on how to dramatically lower stress when the events causing it can\\'t change, I could really use them. I also think the stress is the biggest factor causing the high bp for me. Also, any suggestions on other things I could be doing outside of prescribed medication would be appreciated. Edited: I went to the pcp doctor Wednesday, he immediately put me on blood pressure medication. My blood pressure in the morning for the last two days has been just under 120/80...yay!! I am supposed to go in for a follow up in December.  I\\'m glad my body is already responding so well with a minimum of symptoms, but isn\\'t high blood pressure \"just a symptom\". Should we be looking for the cause of the hbp? I feel like the doctor was just blaming it a little on me getting older. What should I ask/do at this stage?'],\n",

Although I am genetically predisposed to the condition from both parents, I also spent many years being very unhealthy and sedentary. After my weight increased to around 320 pounds and I was diagnosed with sleep apnea, I finally decided to change my lifestyle. Since September of 2018, I've lost over 150 pounds. I eat a clean, plant-based diet with no oil and very little salt. I also do 1 hour of cardio 5-6 days per week. I feel great, but my blood pressure's still elevated. Over the years, I've been on various medications. Lisinopril and then Losartan HCTZ were somewhat helpful for a while, but they both stopped working. So I've spent the past several months trying to find an effective replacement. This year alone, I've been hospitalized twice after having severe reactions to Nifedipine and Carvedilol. I'm also allergic to a few others that I've tried (although not as severely). One more thing, I’ve tried non-traditional aids too (hibiscus tea, garlic extract pills, Hawthorne extract, Michael's blood pressure factor, carditone, beetroot powder, and CoQ10). None of those things reduced my pressure more than a few points. I just don't know what to do.  Right now I'm on Olmesartan 40mg, and my pressure still runs around 145/93 (although it can get as high as 150/100 and as low as 134/88). The bottom number is always the most stubborn especially in the evening and nighttime hours. I could probably deal with being on meds if they were effective. But to be on meds and eat healthy and exercise regularly and be at an ideal weight and STILL have elevated numbers… Well, that has me feeling downright depressed. Any advice? Encouragement even? I know there are other medications to try, but those allergic reactions have given me a level of fear that I can’t fully describe. There has to be something that I’m missing.

My mom does all the right things and weighs all of 89 lbs...but the only thing that keeps her BP in check is the 40 mgs of Licinopril she takes every day.  She has taken the same dose since her 30s - she's 86 now. It was because of her history that they assumed mine was the same, which is why no one thought to look at my kidney until my forties.

I can't say exactly how long I've had this but it's been for a long time. I'm currently 44 years young now. When I spoke to my doctor about 2 years ago, he said has high but nothing to worry about. Then, say about 3 months ago, I had a Liver Biopsy for something else, and the nurses kept saying that my BP was high. They feared it may cause an issue, but it didn't. Fast-forward to today, I've been concerned about this, but with COVID-19, it's been hard to get an appointment. So I've been researching this on my own because I really want to get this down. I currently weigh 248 pounds, I'm stocky. I constantly exercise and yes I do want to lose weight, but I've been this weight every since I got out of the army.  A final reason I want to deal with this is I have Tinnitus and I firmly believe that my BP/HT is contributing to this. My onset of Tinnitus wasn't due to a sickness or loud noise, and I never considered my BP until it was mentioned to me recently.  That makes sense as I can't hear the Tinnitus when sleeping, as my BP is low. As soon as I get up, within 20-30 minutes, it's back. Typically, my HT is quite high, 142/78, 148/87, once it was 150/100. I'd love to get it lower for my health, my sanity and to be around my family longer. Now, I do have an appointment to see my doctor, but it's not until March. So wanted to know, outside of my normal exercise, what can I do to help to lower my BP/HT.

Maybe you are doing something to cause your hypertension , but until you are screened to eliminate the possibility of having endocrine related or renal related hypertension, you will never know whether or not there is an underlying physiological reason for you to be having BP readings like what you mentioned.  Your doctor is doing you a terrible disservice by minimizing your concerns and not going the extra mile to screen you for an underlying issue that he/she knows could cause hypertension. Side Note: I have an Adminstrative background in graduate medical education, and one of the most important lessons I’ve gained from this experience is that all physicians don’t complete their training with the same level of competency.  It is not uncommon for physicians who are dumb as hell to graduate and practice medicine (i.e. Conrad Murray, MJ’s cardiologist, who with at least 10 years of training did not know how to administer CPR when his patient needed it).   General Practitioners are not likely to be well versed in screening for these possibilities.  And Family Medicine Practitioners will almost always tell their patients with resistant hypertension that they need anxiety medication.   So it is extremely important to read and educated yourself as much as you can so that you can advocate for the care that you need.  One of the things that I did was recorded my BP daily (multiple times each day) on an app that allowed me to print a report to present to my doctor.  So with that, my doctors could not minimize my concerns about my HTN because I had DATA, that could not be ignored, minimized or devalued.  It forced them to scratch their own heads.  And foe those who weren’t willing to further investigate, I fired them and moved on.  I much rather a doctor tell me “I don’t know what is happening with your body”, rather than tell me than nothing is wrong or It’s all in my head and then dismiss me.  So I fired doctor after doctor until I found the needle in the haystack.  Doctors, like every other human beings are not perfect, and i’d rather not deal with the ones who think they are and pretend to know everything .  Some are dumb as a box of rusty nails and others are life long learners and will work with you until you are appropriately diagnosed and treated. . . Even if that means consulting with another expert or referring you to someone who can better meet your clinical needs. Please consider getting screened so that you can determine the actual cause of your BP.  A hypertension specialist can help you.

This cant be cured, only controlled thru meds and/or lifestyle. That said, about 10 percent of high blood pressure cases are secondary hypertension, where there is an underlying condition, which often can be treated surgically or medically and can be cured. I had one such form of secondary hypertension when I was a kid, renal artery stenosis, where the artery to one of my kidneys was too narrow, forcing the heart to pump more blood and raising my pressure. I was on meds for several years until I was 15, when an artery was t taken from my leg and grafted onto the kidney, ending the stenosis and lowering my blood pressure. For over 20 years I had normal pressure until in my late 30s I started having high blood pressure again. The docs had a renal ultrasound done to see if it was my kidneys again, but this time they were normal. Went on meds and BP was controlled for over  20 years until I hit 60 and it went out of control again. I was again sent for a renal ultrasound (normal), echocardiogram, which checks the heart (normal), several EKGs over the years (all normal) and numerous blood tests, including cholesterol. Most recently, my doc had my blood tested for cortisol, aldosterone, and renin levels, all of which can affect bp. First two tests were normal but my renin was a bit low although that really only affects the effectiveness of certain drugs like ACE Inhibitors (which may explain why my ACE inhibitor wasn't working and why my doc switched that for a calcium channel blocker, which is working better). Sometimes the adrenal glands can have tumors that can raise pressure. There are tests for that as well. Sorry for the long answer but my point is that a good doctor should do at least some tests to rule out secondary hypertension. Mention some of these tests to your doc and if you are really concerned seek a referral to a specialist like a cardiologist or a nephrologist, who are more likely to look into whether there might be a secondary cause. Most likely you, your hypertension is of the essential kind and you may be on meds like we are, but at least you need to make sure it is not some underlying cause. Good luck!\"],\n",

One night I would measure it and it would be around 128 - 135 / 75 - 85 after a couple of readings. Another night I would measure it and it would be 145 - 155 / 85 - 90. A couple of years ago my blood pressure was as low as 115 / 75 and the highest it would be was 135 / 80. I also suffer from anxiety too meaning just the thought of sitting down and wrapping the thing around my arm starts to make me anxious and then it gets even worst when the buzzing sound starts as the blood pressure machine starts squeezing my arm. I just don't know if I'm suffering from high blood pressure or not and if I should take medication for the rest of my life. Whenever I get measured at the doctor office my blood pressure is usually in the 145 - 150 / 80 - 90 range, but one time I got measure by the dentist and it turned out to be 129 / 78 an another time my doctor measure my blood pressure and she said it was fine because it was 133 / 77. I spoke to my doctor and mention I'm an anxious guy and she told me it could be white coat hypertension. Another doctor wanted to put me on medication like Losartan or Propranolol. I just don't know if I should take them because I don't know if my blood pressure is high or if its just my anxiety. Any advice on what I should do or talk to my doctor about. &#x200B; Some background info is that I'm 31 years old 5ft 9in weighing183lb and I'm trying to lose the weight. I lost about 7 pounds already and my goal in the next couple of months is 170lb. A couple of years ago when I was about 155lb when I visited my other doctor he never mentioned high blood pressure. With this new doctor and the fact that I gained some weight it started to get brought up more. &#x200B; I also notice that if I drink water and a couple of hours past if I measure my blood pressure there's a chance it would be in the 130 / 80 range, but if I drink like coffee which dehydrates you and I don't drink any water my blood pressure goes back up to the 145 - 150 / 80 - 85 range. Do you guys think I have high blood pressure? I just hate the though of taking medication for the rest of my life especially since I'm only 31 years old. Luckily everything else is working fine (knock on wood). No kidney, liver or diabetes issues. &#x200B; Recently a couple of mornings ago after waking up and brushing my teeth before eating anything I measured three times: first time 129 / 72 second time 124 / 74 third time 124 / 80. Then in the evening of that same day it was around the same. Two days ago in the evening afterward I measured my blood pressure and it was 132 / 83, 134 / 82, 132 / 83. It seems my morning blood pressure is lower then my evening blood pressure.\"],\n",

This is a manageable disease if you take it seriously and do the right things.  I've had it for 25 years, I was first diagnosed in my 30s, and I'm now 59.   My quality of life is great and my BP is in normal range.  What I've learned along the way: Take your meds every day without exception.  Otherwise, they do not work.  She needs to get over her dislike of taking a daily pill.   Seriously.  Follow doctor's orders.  Avoid fads and misinformation. There is plenty out there (and some right here on Reddit).  Only follow reputable medical sources, like the Mayo clinic, etc.   If you smoke, then quit.  Seriously.   If you're overweight, then lose weight.  Easier said than done, but this makes the biggest difference for many people. Stop eating junk food.  You are what you eat literally.  Adopt the DASH diet, which is designed by doctors to lower BP.   Google it.  This one isn't hard (for me) because there are so many delicious foods on the list, but you won't find KFC or giant slurpees.   Buy a high-quality BP monitor (Omron is the most reputable brand) and measure BP at home once or twice a week. Keep a log.  Follow the instructions carefully, or you will get false positive readings that will be needlessly alarming.   In short, only measure BP when completely relaxed, and not after eating,  showering,  exercising, or when having a panic  attack.   Add cardio exercise to your life.  Your heart is the most important muscle in your body, and cardio is the best gift you can give it.  Start with a daily walk.  Add in the occasional bike ride.  Join a gym, and try inclined walking on the treadmill or the stationary bike.  Swim.  Aerobics.  Water aerobics. Jogging.  Run a marathon (just kidding).  Invite a friend and make it social.   I think the best thing you can do to help your mom is encourage her to follow the above steps and join her in some activities. Try to make it fun.  All these lifestyle changes will improve her overall health and well-being.  Check in on her.    Hypertension can be hereditary,  so you might get it or already have it.  Maybe you could avoid getting it by making your own lifestyle changes now instead of waiting until it's a crisis.  Good luck.\"],\n",

I\\'m wondering if anyone\\'s had/having a similar experience. I had no history of high blood pressure, but woke up in the middle of the night gasping for air, passed out after standing up, and some other unpleasant symptoms. Responding paramedics reported my BP was 170/120.    \\nAfter a few weeks of monitoring, my doc put me on 5mg of Lisinopril. I\\'ve done ok with the meds the past few months but have had sporadic situations of waking up in the night with palpitations, nausea/gastro distress, feeling shakey/the chills, and often limbs will feel heavy. I sporadically have some dull chest pain, which feels like a muscle ache under my left breast, as if I went too hard on arm day at the gym. Convinced it was the medication and with 2 weeks until a followup appointment, I experimented with cutting the tabs in half to take a 2.5 mg dose and self-monitoring. My blood pressures remained fantastic — in fact, slightly better than the full 5 mg dose. Describing this to my doc, she believes there\\'s no way a 5mg pill could be causing these issues, and that a 2.5mg was essentially a placebo and likely \"not doing anything.\" Maybe, at this point, my body chilled out from the effects of having C-19? I elected to do two weeks of no-med monitoring.   \\nThe first 3 days were great - waking up with readings around 110/63. I was jazzed. Bedtime readings have slowly crept up, starting at 115/78, 125/84, and then reaching 144/98. I don\\'t get it. Out of precaution I popped that 2.5 mg dose of lisinopril until I can speak with the doc next week. But I\\'m at a point where even with more exercise, more water, and continuing a healthy vegetarian/non-processed diet that I\\'m afraid this is a permanent situation. And I\\'m pissed — this whole thing started out of the blue and it feels unfair (I know, welcome to the club). I\\'m also convinced Lisinopril isn\\'t the right med for me, but the doc seems eager to switch to another ACE inhibitor (I\\'m of the believe that if one ACE inhib on a light dose is causing issues, won\\'t they all?). I\\'m interested in something a little less intense like hydrochlorothiazide, but she seems hesitant because it doesn\\'t have as great of \"heart-protecting properties.\"    \\nSorry for this essay, but would love to hear the sub\\'s thoughts, especially if you\\'ve had similar situations.

Last year when I was 21 I started having high blood pressure at the doctor.  They sent me to a cardiologist and had me start taking my bp at home.  I became very ocd with my bp and would take it at least a dozen times a day.  With the numbers at home my doc cleared me and said it was white coat but ordered more tests that showed I had a bicuspid aortic valve. That discovery gave me really bad health anxiety and I started again worrying and taking my blood pressure all the time.  I eventually got my obsession under control and only would take my bp twice a month right when I would wake up.  The numbers were always under 120/80.  Recently i’ve started checking again at a different time of the day and they’re always higher, but not always high.  Yesterday evening before bed I was getting consistent readings of 140/78, and it only dropped to 135/78 after taking multiple readings. I once again took it this morning and it was 119/58. Is this something to be concerned about?  I’m not sure if it was higher in the evening bc I was less relaxed and more aware that I was taking my blood pressure.'],\n",

I was stopped on Lexapro which in fact made me feel so much better no panic attacks no anxiety no worriness. Was stopped on sep. 23rd cold turkey bc sodium levels were at 126 got my sodium back up but I relapsed on having panic attacks and extreme anxiety. Health anxiety everything. It’s weird bc that reading was done laying down. I got to the hospital my blood pressure was 144/85 so way lower forsure.  Any advice any help. I have a fear of having a heart attack. I had a nightmare of having one last night bc I was so worried on it my blood pressure was in the 150/91 I was so worried feel asleep freaking out about it.  \\nI got Zoloft prescribed now but I’m scared to take it since I don’t want side effects to effect my heart beat to go super fast I worry a lot and get scared. Or for my sodium to drop again and have to be taken off as soon as it’s working again I need help.'\n",
